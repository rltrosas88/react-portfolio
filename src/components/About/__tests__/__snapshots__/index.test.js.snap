        I am currently taking part in an Online Coding Boot Camp with the determination to be a Full Stack Programmer. I graduated from the University of Texas Pan-American with a bachelors in Music Education. I have been teaching band to students from 6th grade through 12th grade in a public school setting for the past 8 years. I have a cat named Blue and my interest include traveling, reading, anime, games, and learning new things. Throughout my careers, I continually re-evaluate how I can effectively provide value by broading my knowledge of the skills needed to do my job.
